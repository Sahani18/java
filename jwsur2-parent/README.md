DISCLAIMER:

The code in this project or the ones referring to it are not my own. The code 
accompanies the book "Java Web Services: Up and Running, 2e, by Martin Kalin. 
ISBN-13: 978-1-449-36511-0". My contribution is in "Mavenizing" the projects 
that were originally built by Ant, thereby, bloating the codebase size to almost 175 MB! 
I also made minor changes to some of the code. 
Following is the code usage and distribution policy as copied from the preface 
of the aforementioned book:
